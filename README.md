To Be Updated

Here's a rough sketch of what you should do and in what order:

[X] After receiving the project prompt, decide what kind of app to make, and begin sketching some rough wireframes for how the front end will look and act.
[X] Think about what kind of data your front-end will need from your back-end, and how that data will be used. Create an ERD.
[X] Create two repos that your project will use, and add READMEs to both.
[X] Create a simple front-end with HTML and CSS based (loosely) on your wireframes.
[X] User our rails-api-template for your back-end. It already includes authentication.
[X] After you have an ERD, check with a consultant to ensure your data model is appropriate for your goals. Then, build the     models and migrations to represent this data. Test your models using the Rails console, and test your API endpoints using curl. You may also write automated tests in RSpec if you choose.
[X] Before working on the front-end application, ensure all back-end endpoints work as expected. Knowing the back-end well will help you diagnose bugs on the front-end.
[ ] Write your front-end application using JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.
[ ] Test, commit, and deploy often! Test, commit, deploy! Test your deployments!
[ ] When main features are finished, begin working on stretch goals and icebox features.
[ ] Finish your documentation. Make it high-quality.
